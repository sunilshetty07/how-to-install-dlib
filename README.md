this method works fine. If you frustruated with other methods then give a try to this method. It will definately resolve your problem.


Q)  How to install dlib using anaconda prompt on windows?
Ans:If you write "pip install dlib" you will get error message as cmake not installed. So first install cmake using "pip install CMake". After installing CMake if you write "pip install dlib" you will get error message as building wheel for dlib failed. This is because for dlib you must install c++ compiler. So you have to download visual studio 2019 community and then install the software. After installation download c++ desktop application in visual studio(size is 1.79GB). After installing then go to anaconda command prompt write command as "pip install dlib" or "pip install face_recognition" then it will install everything. So you can now work with dlib for computer vision project. This step will help to install dlib in windows.
